# New Session Start

## Project Context

* Style: concise answers, brievety is important
* Code: write simple concise code. development environment, not optimised for production. no error handling.
* Project: dashboard running on localhost for visualizing banking transactions from my family account.
* Data: transactions available from a local csv file.


## Framework:
- React with Next.js and app router
- Tailwind.css
- Node.js
- Not using Typescript

## Current State
*   **Code Base:** The code is the same from the previous session, with the server component for `/transactions` and the client component for displaying the transactions.

## Specific Goal

In this session, I want to add:
- a filter for the transactions, by payee.
- Transactions should be filterable

## Expected Outcome (Optional)
*  **UI Outcome:**
   *  There should be a text input at the top of the table that allows the user to type in a payee to filter.
   *  The data is shown as a table with 3 columns: date, amount and payee
*  Data Outcome:
   *  The table should only display the data of the specific payee that is being typed.
   *  The total sum of Amount appears at the bottom of the column
